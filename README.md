**Problem Description:**
------------------------------
The goal of this project is to model and build a relational database that captures the main details surronding UFC events, fighters, and associated statistics. The central entity in this data model is the PPV (Pay-Per-View) event, which acts as the main event for the UFC organization. Each PPV is composed of various **headliner fights** , featuring a **winner** and **loser** , whose specific details are recorded. Additionally, we are interested in tracking other important aspects such as the **venue, commentary crew, and social media following** of the UFC fighers. Furthermore, we aim to perform functional queries on this data to provide valuable insights into UFC operations, fight statistics, and fighter performances.
